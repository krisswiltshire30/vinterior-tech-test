#####Reflection
I really enjoyed this tech test. My original plan was using Postgres, but I decided against it as I thought I may have been overcomplicating the requirements for the task.

I ran into an issue where my 'multibuy' method was applying the discount to all items in the basket but that was quickly rectified by using 'select' to pick out the chairs.

#####Notes
100% test coverage
TDD followed religously
